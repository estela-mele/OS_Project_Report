    <h1>Analysis of mail-format.sh Script</h1>
    
    <h2>Script Overview</h2>
    <p>The <code>mail-format.sh</code> script is designed to format email messages by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Removing carets (<code>></code>) and tabs at the beginning of lines</li>
        <li>Folding long lines to a specified maximum width (70 characters by default)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Detailed Code Analysis</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Initial Setup and Argument Checking</h3>
    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# mail-format.sh (ver. 1.1): Format e-mail messages.
# Gets rid of carets, tabs, and also folds excessively long lines.
# =================================================================
# Standard Check for Script Argument(s)
ARGS=1
E_BADARGS=85
E_NOFILE=86</code></pre>
    
    <h3>2. Argument Validation</h3>
    <pre><code>if [ $# -ne $ARGS ] # Correct number of arguments passed to script?
then
    echo "Usage: `basename $0` filename"
    exit $E_BADARGS
fi</code></pre>
    
    <h3>3. File Existence Check</h3>
    <pre><code>if [ -f "$1" ] # Check if file exists.
then
    file_name=$1
else
    echo "File \"$1\" does not exist."
    exit $E_NOFILE
fi</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Execution with Sample Input</h2>
    <p>Sample input file <code>test_email.txt</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>> This is a quoted email message with some excessive
>     indentation and long lines that need to be wrapped. This particular line is definitely longer than seventy characters and should be wrapped by the script.
    This line has leading spaces but no caret.
This line has trailing spaces    
> This is another quoted line.</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Intermediate Results</h2>
    
    <h3>Original Content</h3>
    <div class="output">
        <pre>> This is a quoted email message with some excessive
>     indentation and long lines that need to be wrapped. This particular line is definitely longer than seventy characters and should be wrapped by the script.
    This line has leading spaces but no caret.
This line has trailing spaces    
> This is another quoted line.</pre>
    </div>
    
    <h3>After sed Transformations</h3>
    <div class="output">
        <pre>This is a quoted email message with some excessive
indentation and long lines that need to be wrapped. This particular line is definitely longer than seventy characters and should be wrapped by the script.
This line has leading spaces but no caret.
This line has trailing spaces
This is another quoted line.</pre>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Final Output After Folding</h3>
    <div class="output">
        <pre>This is a quoted email message with some excessive indentation and long
lines that need to be wrapped. This particular line is definitely
longer than seventy characters and should be wrapped by the script.
This line has leading spaces but no caret.
This line has trailing spaces
This is another quoted line.</pre>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The <code>mail-format.sh</code> script provides a simple but effective way to clean up email messages. It demonstrates the power of combining Unix text processing tools like <code>sed</code> and <code>fold</code> to solve common formatting problems.</p>
